The actions or tasks that the user or Database Administrator (DBA) want to
execute on the system are performed by gadgets through the |orchestrator|.
|gadgets| are a collection of executable files that can be invoke by
the |orchestrator| to perform some action or task.

|gadgets| can be implemented in different languages (e.g., Python) and
they provide a rich library that can be reused for the implementation of
new custom gadgets. For more information about the |gadgets| library, see
:ref:`dev-api`.
