MySQL Orchestrator Development Documentation (DevDocs)
======================================================

The MySQL Orchestrator DevDocs are written using Sphinx, therefore you will
need to install Sphinx in order to build the documentation. 

Install Sphinx
--------------

Requirement: Python

You can simply use PyPI to install Sphinx:
shell> pip install --user Sphinx

Or in alternative use your distribution specific installation tool in case it
ships with a recent enough version of Sphinx:

# Ubuntu, Debian
shell> apt-get install python-sphinx

# OpenSuSE
shell> yast install python-Sphinx 

# Fedora
shell> yum install python-sphinx 


NOTE: If you don't have enough privileges 'sudo' might be required to install
      it (to run the command as a root).

More information: http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html

Install PlantUML
----------------

PlantUML is used to generate UML graphs from text notations in the
Sphinx documentations, and it is required to build those graphs correctly.

Requirements: 
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php)

1 - First, install PlantUML dependencies (JRE and Graphviz), for example using
their packages for Linux distributions:

# Ubuntu, Debian
shell> apt-get install graphviz default-jre-headless 

2 - Download the latest version of plantuml from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download

3- Place it anywhere you like (e.g., your $HOME) and create a wrapper script
for it (assuming ~/bin/ is in your $PATH and exists already):

shell> cat <<EOF > ~/bin/plantuml
#!/bin/sh -e
java -jar ~/plantuml.jar "$@"
EOF

shell> chmod u+x ~/bin/plantuml

4 - Verify if plantUML is working, for example checking its version:

shell> plantuml -version
PlantUML version 8040beta0 (Fri Apr 22 17:24:28 WEST 2016)
(GPL source distribution)
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
1.8.0_92-b14
Linux

The environment variable GRAPHVIZ_DOT has not been set
Dot executable is /usr/bin/dot
Dot version: dot - graphviz version 2.36.0 (20140111.2315)
Installation seems OK. File generation OK

5 - Setup PlantUML with Sphinx.
    Install the plantuml extension for sphinx from PyPI with:

shell> pip install --user sphinxcontrib-plantuml

More information:
 - http://plantuml.com/
  - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-plantuml


Build DevDocs
-------------

After installing all required packages and dependencies you should be able
to build the documentation (if needed).

To build the documentation and generate 'HTML' output, run:
shell> make html

The documentation will be build in the '_build' folder, then you just need to
open the _build/html/index.html file with our browser to read it.
